# Mobinext: MSO Frontend Prototype (React Native + Expo)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Expo App w/ Typescript](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/#starting-from-scratch-using-a-typescript-template).

## Setup

### `npm i` => If this is not working try `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

### `npx expo login` => Login with your Expo credentials (optional)

### `npx expo whoami` => Check if login worked (optional)

### `npx expo start` => Start the project

## How to open the app?

There are serval options to run and open the app.

The easiest option is to run it on your physical smartphone via the Expo Go App, which is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/expo-go/id982107779) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=de&gl=US).

Otherwise, its possible to open it with an [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) or [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/).
